#NodeRPG

##I woke up one morning and wanted to make a rpg in node.js

Download node.js, open cmd to the folder with these files in it and run node index.js
Should be played on a number pad, using 1-5 and the enter key, however you can also use:
1. l
2. ;
3. ' 
4. o
5. p

So try and get a high score!
